Design of a Current Meter for Measurement Under Normal Operation and Deep Sleep Conditions on a Microcontroller
With the growing demand for energy-efficient embedded systems, the ability to accurately measure
current consumption across different operating states of a microcontroller has become increasingly
important. Many battery-operated devices, such as those based on the ESP32, rely on sleep and
active cycles to prolong operational life. Consequently, monitoring current in both active and deep
sleep modes is essential for evaluating and optimizing energy consumption.
This project addresses that need by designing a battery-powered electronic circuit capable of mea-
suring the current drawn by a microcontroller as it alternates periodically between its normal and
deep sleep modes. Furthermore, to facilitate real-time monitoring and data logging, the measured
current is wirelessly transmitted to a computer or mobile device. The complete solution includes
the design of the printed circuit board (PCB), as well as a control interface that allows both manual
and automatic switching between current measurement ranges.
